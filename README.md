# At first I thought what will I do then I overview the Figma file.
# After that I thought at first I will design the whole project, after words I start designing the whole project.
# While designing the project I faced some challenges after a couple of minutes, I did it well.
# After finishing the design of the whole project then I will move to dynamic code interaction
# While dynamic code interaction I faced some challenges, then I thought about how I will do this easy way, after that I searched Google and youtube on how to solve this problem.
# From Google and YouTube I got a lot of solutions in many ways then I solved this problem.
# From starting the day when you provided me with this task. This task was some instructions like what I will do before starting the project, but I forgot that first initial commit, I did not commit on Git Hub. This is a big mistake, please pardon me, hope you will consider this matter.
# okay! Thank you so much for your valuable time. I hope to hear from you soon with good news.
